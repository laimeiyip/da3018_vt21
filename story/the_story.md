# A story in DA3018

Once upon a time two tomatoes were crossing a road, when one of them suddenly got run over by a taxi cab.
Then the other tomato said: Hey friend, catch up!
Ketchup said: No, I can't. My legs are all mashed up now. Let's call sausage for help.
Then the NY Cab Driver that drove over Ketchup said: "I'm drivin' 'ere!!"

Sausage picked up the phone and Tomato explained what had happened. Being
of the opportunistic kind, and without any regard for the ethical problems
of turning your friends into food, Sausage suggested that Tomato offer the
cab driver some of Ketchup.

But what would the cab driver do with the offered condiment without any food to eat it with?

But the cab driver was long gone. Not willing to leave his saucy friend behind Tomato
quickly scooped Ketchup into a rusty old bucket he found sitting next to the road.
"Lets not let this keep us down!", said Tomato while skipping off the road,
"Gurglegurgle", answered Ketchup. Feeling bad for his friend and trying to lighten the mood, the Tomato tried to come up with a joke, after some time he opened his mouth and said...
